<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

FaceLens is a cutting-edge web application that leverages state-of-the-art neural approaches for precise and efficient face recognition. Designed with professionalism and accuracy in mind, it empowers users to perform facial recognition tasks effortlessly.

### High-Level Architecture

![High-Level Architecture](images/architecture.drawio.png)

FaceLens comprises two primary components:

1. **User-Friendly Interface**: Our intuitive UI enables users to seamlessly capture photos using their webcams or upload images for analysis. Developed with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery, it ensures a smooth user experience.

2. **Advanced Backend**: The backend employs a sophisticated convolutional deep learning approach, implemented with TensorFlow and Keras in a Python environment, to process images from the UI. This ensures accurate and reliable face recognition results.
