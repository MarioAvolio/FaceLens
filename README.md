<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

FaceLens is a web application designed for face recognition using neural approaches. It leverages the capabilities of your device's camera to perform face recognition based on various features and the biological characteristics of the human face.

### High-Level Architecture

![High-Level Architecture](images/architecture.drawio.png)

The application consists of two main components:

1. **User-Friendly UI**: This component allows users to capture pictures from their webcams or upload images. It is built using Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery.

2. **Backend**: The backend processes the images captured by the UI using a convolutional deep learning approach implemented with TensorFlow and Keras in a Python environment.
